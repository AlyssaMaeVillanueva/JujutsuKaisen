         Gojo inherited the<br> Limitless technique from his<br> family, but it can only be truly <br> mastered by one who also<br>
          possesses Six Eyes. Through <br>cursed energy manipulation, Gojo <br> has absolute control over space <br> at an atomic level.</span>

    Does Megumi have a cursed <br> technique?
    The Ten Shadows Cursed Technique gives Megumi the<br> ability to call on ten powerful <br>shikigami, but its true power <br>
    comes from its flexibility in <br> combat. Despite the great lengths <br> Megumi has pushed his cursed <br>technique to, fans 
    know that one <br>cannot rule the shadows with <br>cursed techniques alone
