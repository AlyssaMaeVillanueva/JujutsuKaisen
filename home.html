        <h4>  Tokyo Metropolitan Curse  Technical High School</h4>
        <p> Tokyo Jujutsu High serves not only as a training ground for the next 
            generation of sorcerers but a headquarters for all alumni who have  graduated 
            on to be full-fledged jujutsu sorcerers as well. All sorcerers play a role in
            mentoring jujutsu students, whether in a teacher's role or  accompanying them  
            on missions. Weaker sorcerers are assigned the roles of windows,  someone 
            who can see  curses but is not considered a full-fledged  sorcerer or managers 
            <br> to contribute as well. The jujutsu schools are  considered the place for the 
            community and provide mediation,  general support, education, and shelter</p>

        <h4> Location </h4>
        <p > Tokyo Jujutsu High is a broad campus of several buildings build in a traditional 
            Japanese architectural style, operating under the guise of a Buddhist temple.
            The school building is well hidden on Tokyo's outskirts, far and high in the  mountains.
            Naturally, there are a lot of trees around the property to further  obscure the location
            Some elements other than the buildings reflect the  Buddhist theme.
            There are several statues of deities, shrines, and  torii gates around the campus.
            There are several entrances into the school. The entire property  
            is hidden by a protective barrier maintained by Master Tengen,
            who  lives beneath the school in the star's underground tombs.
            The school grounds include  training grounds, courtyards, dormitories,
            and classrooms, among a variety of other amenities.</p>

        <h4> Administration</h4> </h4>
        <p >The members of authority at Jujutsu High are known as the "higher-ups". The higher-ups 
            control the majority of decisions revolving around the school. They hold their meetings 
            in a dimly lit room with a single light that illuminates whoever is speaking to the board. 
            The higher-ups' bodies are hidden from view using doors that stand on their own. 
            Their members consists of older men like Kyoto Principal, Yoshinobu Gakuganji.They 
            are conservative traditionalists that often clash with those that have progressive ambition 
            like Satoru Gojo.[6][7] Many of the politics involved with governing the jujutsu community 
            effects the school and its students. Both Yuta Okkotsu and Yuji Itadori were isolated on
             campus in sealed rooms and initially scheduled for execution. Even after being vouched 
             for by Satoru Gojo, both students, who enrolled at two different times, have only had 
             their executions suspended since</p>

        <h4> Rules & Security</h4> </h4>
        <p >   Upon enrolling in Jujutsu High, transfer students are taught about the school's
            rules and security measures. The school is protected by Master Tengen's
             barrier, which hides its location from the outside world. Those who already
             know the location can easily find it. One entrance is in the foothills of 
             Mount Mushiro up a long set of stairs marked with a series of torii gates.
            All jujutsu sorcerers must abide by jujutsu regulations. There appear to be
             several articles, most of which have not been revealed. They call for someone's 
             immediate execution even if they become a potential vessel to a curse as powerful as
             Sukuna. Article 9 of the jujutsu regulations punishes jujutsu sorcerers turned
              curse users with execution as well.</p>

        <h4> Curriculum</h4> </h4>
        <p > The school's curriculum is taught over four years.The concept is to
            train young sorcerers to control their curses and use them to exorcise other
            curses. All classes appear to be taught by active professional jujutsu sorcerers.
            The teachers regulate their students' training regiments and education as they
            see fit. Sorcerers are rare, so classes are often small and focused on building
            up the individual students into competent sorcerers as quickly as possible.
            Students are given a formal education with standard school classes such as homeroom
            and sorcerer training through practical jujutsu classes.They move from their
            original homes to live on campus in the dormitories. The majority of training, classes
            and school events are all conducted on campus grounds.Practical training assignments
            and field tests often consist of investigating paranormal locations and exorcising 
            weaker curses.Jujutsu High students are ranked on the same scale as
            professional jujutsu sorcerers, which their student ID reflects.Same as 
            jujutsu sorcerers, students are given missions according to their ranking. When 
            leaving school grounds to exorcise curses as a part of their training to gain experience
        , students are often supervised by a sorcerer or manager</p>

        <h4> Uniform</h4> </h4>
        <p >The male school uniform consists of asymmetrical blue jackets with high collars and two 
            pins on the left side engraved with the school logo. The male uniform is completed with 
            a pair of matching blue slacks. The standard female uniform has the same top with a skirt 
            for a bottom. The uniforms are highly customizable, and many of the students have their own 
            variations of the uniform. The top half of Nobara's uniform is similar to a traditional 
            gakuran uniform, with buttons from top to bottom down the middle. Yuta's uniform is all white,
             and Yuji's uniform is customized with a hood as one of many possible examples.
            Jujutsu High has summer and winter uniforms like most Japanese schools. There usually 
            isn't much difference between them other than breathability because the uniforms must remain
         practical for combat. If a student desires a custom uniform, they can put in a request with the school</p>
